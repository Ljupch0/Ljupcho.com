    <h1>The Libra Opportunity</h1>

    <p>tldr: Libra is Facebook's next biggest play in its battle to stay relevant by providing another utility in addition to communication, payments.
      Libra will be more of a globalized payment method than a real cryptocurrency. Because of regulatory risk and complexity Facebook will leave to 3rd parties to convert cash to Libra,
      and will focus on never giving you a reason to convert back to cash. Entrepreneurs can step in to handle the on-ramp and charge conversion fees.

    <h3>Communication Networks vs Payment Networks</h3>
    <p> Libra is facebook's fulfillment of its long standing envy towards WeChat, China's utility app that has provided a
    popular digital payments service since XXX. Networks effects around communication and chat are one pillar
    which makes an app hihgly defensible, however they are complemented by the network effects that come
    from the number of users that pay in and the number of merchants that accept a certain payment method.
    Payment NFX are complementary to communication NFX because in addition to P2P money transfers between users,
    transactions can take place between users and merchants. Facebook already has the users for P2P, and having the users will attract the merchants.
    Simply having all your friends in one app makes you stay, but also getting paid there cements you as a user. </p>
    <br>
    Paypal understood well network effects in payment systems and invented the growth hack that every funded
    fintech startup (and airbnb) is using today: invite a friend, both of you get 10 dollars. The success of
    this hack in getting users, coupled with the success with getting merchants via Ebay, has cemented Paypal
    as the dominant online payment method to this day. Even though Ebay bought Paypal for 1.2Billion in XXXXX,
    the value of Paypal today is 136 billion, exactly four times grater than its parent Ebay's vlaue of 34B,
    diven by the growth of the internet and it's position of the internet's payment processor. To establish a
    new dominant payment system in 2019, Facebook is developing Libra beyond itself. In the Libra Foundation, it has already enlisted online hard hitters like XXXX. Facebook will bring the users with Libra, their partners will provide places to spend that Libra, to bring Libra to the unbanked, and to xxxx
