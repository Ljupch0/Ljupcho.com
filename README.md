My personal site made with pure HTML and deployed on netlify.

A bit of effort is worth it to get a lean and  fast site.
Tip: Designing mobile responsiveness is surprisingly simpler when using @media (max-width: 1000px) for both mobile and tablet, and @media (min-width: 1000px) for everything larger.
